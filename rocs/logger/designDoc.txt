CSC253: Final Project

Logger

The logger will be a singleton object used by Ruby code. There will be three supported public methods:
- Logger.warn : For problems that arise but do not prevent continued program operation.
- Logger.error : For problems that arise that halt program operation.
- Logger.info : For general information describing program operation.

The logs will be stored in a file on disk in the logger director. They will always be appended to the end of the file. The file will be named  according to a parameter from the Config module.
